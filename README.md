# Go-Discovery
This repo contains a script which will help you setup for the Go discovery workshop at Holberton School

If you are on one of the school's computers, use the following commands in your terminal:

  1. Clone this repository:
    - git clone https://github.com/holbertonschoolstudents/Go-Discovery.git
  2. Go inside the directory of the repo:
    - cd Go-Discovery
  3. Unpack the 'createGopath.tar.gz' file:
    - tar -xvf createGopath.tar.gz
    - It should display x createGopath.bash if everything is successful
  4. Run the script file that was just unpacked:       
    - bash createGopath.bash (this may take a few moments to complete)
  5. Source your profile:
    - source ~/.bash_profile
  6. Open Atom from your terminal (!important):
    - atom .
    - or, if that fails, use: open -a atom
  7. Through Atom, install the go-plus package:
    - find the package installer in ATOM>PREFERENCES, and click on the INSTALL menu tab. Finally, use the search box to find 'go-plus' and install the package! 


If you are not on one of the school's computers, and are using Mac OS, you can still follow these directions but you will first need to install Go version 1.6 (https://golang.org/doc/install), and the Atom editor (https://atom.io/).
